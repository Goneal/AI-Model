# Data Collection Plan

## Objective
Gather and document iOS projects that implement various architectures to create a comprehensive dataset for training the AI model.

## Steps

1. **Identify Sources**
   - Use repositories like "munibsiddiqui/ios-architectures" and "vasily-popov/emplesSwift" as primary sources.
   - Explore additional open-source iOS projects that demonstrate different architectural patterns.

2. **Document Architectural Patterns**
   - Analyze and document the architectural decisions and patterns used in each project.
   - Include details on UI frameworks, networking solutions, and dependency injection frameworks.

3. **Organize Data**
   - Categorize projects based on their architectural patterns.
   - Ensure data is well-structured and annotated for model training.

4. **Prepare Dataset**
   - Format the collected data into a dataset suitable for training the AI model.
   - Include metadata and annotations for each project.

## Next Steps
- Begin collecting and documenting iOS projects with different architectures.
- Organize the data and prepare it for model training.
