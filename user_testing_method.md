# User Testing Method

## Objective
Create a system for users to evaluate the AI model's performance on various iOS development tasks and provide feedback on its capabilities.

## Components

1. **Test Scenarios**
   - Develop a set of iOS development tasks that the AI model will perform.
   - Include tasks related to architectural decision-making, code generation, and feature implementation.

2. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - Implement a feedback form or survey for users to provide input on the AI model's performance.
   - Include questions on accuracy, efficiency, and usability.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Define criteria for assessing the AI model's performance, such as code quality, architectural choices, and alignment with best practices.

4. **Iteration and Improvement**
   - Use user feedback to refine the AI model and improve its capabilities.
   - Continuously update the testing method based on user input and new developments.

## Next Steps
- Share the testing method with the user for feedback.
- Begin implementing the test scenarios and feedback mechanism.
