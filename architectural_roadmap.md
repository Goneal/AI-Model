# Architectural Decision-Making Roadmap

## Objective
Enhance the AI model's ability to make informed architectural decisions by training it on various iOS architectures such as MVC, MVVM, MVP, VIPER, and Clean Architecture.

## Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather open-source iOS projects that implement different architectures.
   - Document the architectural patterns and decision-making processes.

2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Curate a dataset of iOS projects with annotated architectural decisions.
   - Include examples of successful architectural implementations.

3. **Model Training**
   - Train the AI model on the curated dataset.
   - Focus on improving the model's ability to recognize and evaluate different architectures.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Develop criteria for evaluating the model's architectural decisions.
   - Test the model on real-world scenarios to assess its performance.

5. **Iteration and Improvement**
   - Continuously update the dataset with new architectural examples.
   - Refine the model based on feedback and evaluation results.

## Next Steps
- Share the roadmap with the user for feedback.
- Begin implementing the data collection and dataset preparation phases.
