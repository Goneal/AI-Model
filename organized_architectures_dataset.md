# Organized Architectures Dataset

## Objective
Create a structured dataset of documented architectural patterns from various iOS projects to train the AI model.

## Data Structure

1. **Project Name**
   - **Architecture Type**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER, etc.
   - **UI Framework**: Storyboard, SnapKit, SwiftUI, etc.
   - **Networking Solution**: URLSession, Moya, etc.
   - **Dependency Injection Framework**: FieryCrucible, DIP, Swinject, etc.
   - **Notes**: Additional information about the project and architecture.

## Included Projects

1. **munibsiddiqui/ios-architectures**
   - Documented patterns from MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER, and RIBs.

2. **vasily-popov/emplesSwift**
   - Documented patterns from MVC, MVP, MVVM (RxSwift), and VIPER.

3. **tailec/ios-architecture**
   - Documented patterns from MVC, MVP, MVVM (RxSwift), VIPER, and Reactor.

## Next Steps
- Use this dataset to train the AI model on architectural decision-making.
- Continuously update the dataset with new architectural examples.
