Organize and annotate the following Swift files for training the AI model on iOS app architectures and design patterns:

1. /home/ubuntu/AI-Model/Sources/MyApp/MyApp.swift
   - Focus on main app structure and entry point.

2. /home/ubuntu/AI-Model/Tests/MyAppTests/CreateLoginUITests.swift
   - Annotate UI test patterns and structure.

3. /home/ubuntu/MyApp/Models/UserAuthenticationManager.swift
   - Highlight user authentication logic and API interaction patterns.

Create input-output pairs for supervised learning by extracting relevant code snippets and their corresponding architectural descriptions.
